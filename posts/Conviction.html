        Conviction Politicians
    </div>

    <div id="post-text">

            The only politicians worth their salt to me are what are called conviction politicians. Career politicians
            really give
            the word a bad name. people who see it as a duty and not a job so they can retire to consultant positions on
            boards of
            companies they helped along the way, or to the comfort of the vermin in the House of Lords. Sorry, I meant
            to type
            “ermine”.

            To me, the only politicians who deserve any respect are the conviction politicians. Career politicians have
            dragged the
            word “politician” through the mud—treating it as a cushy gig, a stepping stone to consultant roles on
            corporate boards
            they propped up in office, or a ticket to lounge among the vermin (sorry, I meant “ermine”) in the House of
            Lords.
            Conviction politicians, on the other hand, see it as a duty, not a job. They lay out their beliefs, stick to
            their guns,
            and do what they promised if they get the chance to lead. I don’t have to agree with their politics—and
            often I
            don’t—but I admire their honesty, a quality rarer than a unicorn in Westminster or Washington.

            Here’s my list of politicians who, in my view, fit the bill. They come from the left, right, and center,
            spanning
            decades and borders. It’s UK-heavy because that’s my lens, but I’m sure there are more out there worth
            naming. In no
            particular order, just as they popped into my head
