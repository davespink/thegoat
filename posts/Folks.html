        A New social media experiment - Different Folks
    </div>

    <div id="post-text">

        “Different strokes by different folks” attributed to Mohamed Ali and made popular by Sly and the Family
        Stone, “Everyday People”, is an exciting new website. A social experiment to find out just how different
        people are. The backbone is a series of self reported questionnaires on all possible subjects. All answers
        are voluntary and all people are of course allowed to lie. Data collection is for the purpose of statistics
        but also to build up a digital DNA of each user. A simple example is “choose colors of the rainbow in order
        of preference”. Personal data such as height, weight, salary, location, health, history etc. you name it can
        all be given voluntarily or as a lie. It’s meant to be fun, and will be mixed in with quizzes, competitions,
        data insights, graphs. Did you know that the most popular ice-cream in Russia is strawberry? This sort of
        info would be an easy sell on social media, who isn’t nosey?

        So welcome to different-folks.com.
